1. Download a No-CD patch for Dungeon Siege 1. A No-CD patch is a modified executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to run the game without the disc. You can find some No-CD patches online, such as from [GameCopyWorld\[^1^\]](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_dungeon_siege.shtml) or [GameBurnWorld\[^2^\]](https://gameburnworld.com/gp/gamefixes/dungeonsiege.shtml). Make sure you download the patch that matches your game version and language.
2. Unzip the No-CD patch and copy it to your game directory. Replace the original DUNGEONSIEGE.EXE file with the one from the patch. You may want to make a backup of the original file before you overwrite it.
3. Launch the game and enjoy. You should be able to play Dungeon Siege 1 without a CD now.

Alternatively, you can also create a backup image of your Dungeon Siege 1 CD and mount it on a virtual drive. A backup image is a file that contains all the data from your CD, which can be used as a substitute for the physical disc. You can use a program like [PowerISO](https://www.poweriso.com/) or [DAEMON Tools Lite](https://www.daemon-tools.cc/products/dtLite) to create and mount backup images. However, you may need to remove the CD protection from the image first, using a program like [GameBurnWorld\[^2^\]](https://www.gameburnworld.com/gp/gamefixes/dungeonsiege.shtml).
 
Another option is to install Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna, which is an expansion pack for Dungeon Siege 1 that does not require a CD to play. It also includes the original game, so you can play both with one installation. You can find Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna online, such as from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/39190/Dungeon_Siege/) or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/dungeon_siege_collection). However, you may need to update your game to the latest version and apply some compatibility fixes to run it on modern systems.
